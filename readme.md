## Flashcards

## Lab 4

### App Description
Finally, in this add-on to the Flashcards project, there is now a custom app icon and splash screen, as well as animations throughout the application. When tapping on a flashcard to reveal the answer, a flipping animation is displayed. When the user taps on the next or previous buttons, the flashcard will slide across the screen and out of view, with the new flashcard coming into view. Multiple choice answer order is also now randomized, flashcards are nicely stylized, and the app will now resize itself on larger or smaller device screens.

## Lab 2

### App Description
This is an addition to the previous Flashcards project. This Flashcards app presents the user with a specific question, presented in the form of a card. When the user taps on this flashcard, the answer to the question is revealed in place of it. If it is tapped a second time, the question can be viewed again. Multiple choice answer buttons are placed beneath the flashcard, allowing the user to pick an option. If the answer is incorrect, the button will disappear. If the answer is correct, the answer will be revealed in place of the flashcard. If the "+" button is clicked, the user can enter a new question and answer, as a way to create a new flashcard. Two extra multiple choice answers can be entered, with an error being shown if text fields are empty. The user can also edit the existing flashcard by using the edit button.
